## Investigating Indicators of Heart Disease
This project was completed as part of the **Statistics for Data Science** module in the **Data Science Certificate program** at the University of Waterloo.

#### Project Overview
This repository contains the work of Group 11 (Jennifer Attema, Paras Bhatia, John Ing, Rafick Jungul, Rosy Zhou) for a project investigating potential indicators of heart disease. The project used an annual survey dataset of over 400,000 adults from the CDC to explore relationships between factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep time, BMI, and mental health with the presence of heart disease. The analysis utilized various statistical tests, including Chi-Square, Mann-Whitney U, and Logistic Regression, to identify significant associations and challenge common assumptions. The ultimate goal was to provide insights that could inform heart disease prevention and intervention strategies.
